# STM32-attitude-estimation
This code is a part of STM32 attitude estimation course:
https://www.steppeschool.com/courses/stm32-hal-orientation-estimation
The course explains how to compute an attitude of an object based on quaternions and Euler angles using IMU sensors.
In this course, we used MPU6050 and MPU9250 IMU sensors
